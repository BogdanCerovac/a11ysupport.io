# Differences between Voice Control Software

Dragon, Voice Access, and Voice Control perform similar functions and are operated in similar ways. Users can operate the device by speaking commands like "click <name>" or "choose <number>" and dictate text when in an input. Most also offer the concept of a grid overlay to interact with parts of the screen that are missing roles and names. Some differences include:

* Dragon will let users interact with content by role, while Voice Access and Voice Control will not. For example, in Dragon users can say "click button" to flag each element with the button role on the page with a number, and then say "choose <number>".
* Voice Access and Voice Control will flag each element with the same name for disambiguation while Dragon will not. Dragon will simply click (or otherwise interact with) the first element of that name. 
* Voice Control offers overlays for names, numbers, and grid, while Dragon only offers an overlay for grid, and Voice Access only offers and overlay for numbers.
* While Voice Access does not support saying something like "click <role>", only elements with interactive roles such as buttons and links are flagged with numbers.
