# Orca

Orca is a free (and open source) screen reader for Linux based computers.

## TODO

This information is still in development. Feel free to contribute. The following still needs to be done:

* Add information on how to capture output for tests (manual, copy/paste, etc)
* add details on how to find the version of the sr and os
* Proof read
* Ensure that the listed commands are accurate and make sense

## Install

Orca is bundled with Gnome based distributions, such as Ubuntu

## Guides, Documentation, and resources

* [Orca User Guide](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/)

## How to find version

From command line, run `orca --version`

## Modes

* Browse mode: This is the default mode when using a browser.
* Focus mode: With default settings, this mode will automatically turn on when navigating to certain interactive elements (such as radio buttons or text inputs, etc.). It can be manually turned on or off by use of <kbd>Insert</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> keys.
