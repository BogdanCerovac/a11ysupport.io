# Voice Access for Android

Voice Access for Android is a free voice control app by Google for Android.

There are 1 types of overlay that you can turn on.

* "show numbers" will turn on an overlay that displays a number for every interactive element on the page. This is helpful when an element is missing a name, or if the user does not know how to pronounce a name.
* Voice Access does not have name or grid overlays that are often found in other Voice Control software.
