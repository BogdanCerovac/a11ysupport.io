# VoiceOver for MacOS

VoiceOver is free and built in to MacOS.

## TODO

This information is still in development. Feel free to contribute. The following still needs to be done:

* Add information on how to capture output for tests (manual, copy/paste, etc)
* add details on how to find the version of the sr and os
* Proof read
* Ensure that the listed commands are accurate and make sense

## Install

VoiceOver is built in to MacOS and can be enabled from the System Preferences app.

## Guides, Documentation, and resources

* [Apple documentation](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/)
* [Deque guide](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/voiceover-keyboard-shortcuts)

## Modes

VoiceOver does not have the same concept of modes that many other screen readers have.
