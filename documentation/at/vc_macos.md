# Voice Control for MacOS

Voice Control for iOS is a voice control system that can be found in MacOS 10.15 and greater.

There are 2 types of overlays that you can turn on.

* "show numbers" will turn on an overlay that displays a number for every element on the page. This is helpful when an element is missing a name, or if the user does not know how to pronounce a name.
* "show grid" will turn on an overlay that displays a numbered grid over the screen that allows the user to interact with parts of the screen that don't have names or numbers. For example, a user can zoom in on grid a grid number until it is large enough to cover an incorrectly coded icon button without a name or role, then pan the screen so that the number is over the button, and then say "tap <number>" to activate the button.
