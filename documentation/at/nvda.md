# NVDA

Non Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a popular free (and open source) screen reader for Windows based computers.

## TODO

This information is still in development. Feel free to contribute. The following still needs to be done:

* Add information on how to capture output for tests (manual, copy/paste, etc)
* add details on how to find the version of the sr and os
* Proof read
* Ensure that the listed commands are accurate and make sense

## Install

1. [Download NVDA from their website](https://www.nvaccess.org/).
2. [The Focus Highlight](https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/focusHighlight.en.html) plugin can make NVDA easier to use and learn for sighted users.

## Guides, Documentation, and resources

* [NVDA User Guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html)
* [NVDA issue tracker](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues)
* [Deque guide](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/nvda-keyboard-shortcuts)

## Modes

* Browse mode: This is the default mode when using a browser.
* Focus mode: With default NVDA settings, this mode will automatically turn on when navigating to certain interactive elements (such as radio buttons or text inputs, etc.). It can be manually turned on or off by use of <kbd>Insert</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> keys.
