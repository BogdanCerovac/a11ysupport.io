<h1>HTML role attribute for voice control test</h1>

<p>This page tests how the voice control software uses the role attribute.</p>

<p>To pass:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the VC supports activating by role (Dragon), the test passes if the button in test 2 activates.</li>
    <li>If the VC supports showing numbers for interactive elements, the test passes if all buttons are flagged with numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>test 1: just a button role</h2>
<p>For this test, just a div with a button role was used. It is not in the tab order and does not have a click event, as these aspects could, in theory, independently cause voice control software to consider the element as interactive.</p>
<div role="button" id="target-1">target 1</div>

<h2>test 2: button role with click event</h2>
<p>For this test, the div has a button role and a click event. The click event is present for VC that supports activating by role, since without the click event, it may not be obvious if the command was successful.</p>
<div role="button" id="target-2" onclick="alert('target 1 clicked')">target 2</div>
