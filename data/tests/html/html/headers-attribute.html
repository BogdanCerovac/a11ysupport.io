<h1>Headers attribute test</h1>

<p>Expected headers for target: "negative, mood". Note: when using table navigation, screen readers will often reduce verbosity by not announcing headers multiple times; they will only announce changes to headers as you navigate through cells. Therefore, when navigating down from the "negative" header, it is okay to only hear the "mood" header.</p>
