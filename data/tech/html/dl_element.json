  "recommendation": "The `dl` element and its associated `dt` and `dd` elements have poor to non-existent support. If it is critically important to convey relationships between terms and descriptions and the values of the two can be confused with eachother (think a matching list of colors such as \"red: blue\", consider another approach such as a table or headings. It is often possible for a user to determine which text is a key and which text is a value just based upon the text alone. If this is the case for your implementation, it might be fine to use a `dl` element and hope for better support in the future.",
