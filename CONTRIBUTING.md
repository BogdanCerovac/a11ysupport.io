## Tell us that something is wrong

We can't get everything right. And let's be honest, this project represents a huge amount of work by a lot of people. We are human and we make mistakes. But in order for us to fix those mistakes, we must first know about them. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/accessibilitysupported/accessibilitysupported/issues) to bring something to our attention.

When creating an issue, please be as detailed as you can.

## Add or modify a support point

The best thing you can do to help us out is to run tests against specific AT/Browser combinations and contribute your findings back to us.

A support point is the support value for a given AT/Browser/Test.

1. Find a test that you want to run.
2. Run the test and follow the provided instructions so that you understand the expected results.
3. Open an issue that details the results or create a pull request with your findings. Be sure to provide specific versions of both the AT and Browser that were used.
4. Your findings must be verified by at least one other person before they are accepted.

## Suggest a missing test case

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/accessibilitysupported/accessibilitysupported/issues) or create a pull request to suggest a new test case. Details for the test case should include:

1. A name for the test case.
2. Sample code for the test case.
3. The Expected output and instructions.
4. Any current support if you know it.
5. All new test cases must be approved by at least one other person.

## Improve a test case

If you find a problem with a test case, please [create an issue](https://github.com/accessibilitysupported/accessibilitysupported/issues) or create a pull request to detail the problem. Any changes to a test case must be approved by one other person.

## Suggest a new technology

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/accessibilitysupported/accessibilitysupported/issues) or create a pull request to suggest a new technology. A new technology should include:

1. A link to the standard that supports the technology
2. Any relevant links to aid in determining the correct AT behavior when interacting with the technology.
3. At least one feature with at least one test.
4. If possible, please include support details for the provided tests.

All new technologies must be approved by at least one other person.

## Suggest a new feature

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/accessibilitysupported/accessibilitysupported/issues) or create a pull request to suggest a new feature. A new feature should include:

1. A name for the feature.
2. Links to relevant standards to support the feature and AT interaction.
3. At least one test case.
4. Any support details that you are aware of.

All new features must be approved by at least one other person.
